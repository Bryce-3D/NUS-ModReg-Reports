**Focus Areas Speedrun** </br>
*Single sem only mods are taken based on which sem they're in for AY22/23 </br>
*Assume that pre-req waivers are always rejected </br>
*Assume that there are never any exam or timetable clashes </br>
</br>
</br>
Minimum number of sems for each focus area (constructions provided below)
```
3 - Algo, AI, Cybersec, Multimedia, Networking, SWE
4 - CG, Database, Parallel, Programming Langs
```
</br>

Default pre-clearing (max possible for single degree CS):
```
CS1101S - iBLOC the sem before matric
CS2040S - CS2040 the special term before matric

</br>

Reasoning for the focus areas that take more than 3 sems
```
CG - Difficult since everything has CS3241 as an (implicit) prereq, and CS3241 is sem 1 only
Database - Difficult since it is impossible to do this without CS3223, which is sem 2 only
Parallel, Languages - Difficult since all 4 primaries are single sem only mods
```
</br>
*Algo can be reduced to 2 sems if you are ddp math+cs by taking placement to skip MA1521/MA2002, then doing ST2334 in sem 1 and CS3236 in sem 2
